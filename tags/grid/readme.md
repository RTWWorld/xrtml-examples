# xRTML Grid Tag
The tag Grid allows the users to mark slots in a grid. The slots have a state and can have metadata associated.
To render the slots, the tag uses a KnockoutJS (http://www.knockoutjs.com) template is used which can be provided in the tag configuration, otherwise a default is provided, to which styles can be applied using xRTML's CSS structure.

## How it works
The intent of this demo is to show how to create a Grid tag with initial data.
