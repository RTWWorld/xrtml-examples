# xRTML Console Module

This module provides a cross-browser wrapper to the javascript console. If the browser has a javascript console, then it will use it, otherwise you will have to install or import a third party plugin/script to your page.

If you have the `xRTML.Config.debug` falg active, xRTML will be logging to your console usefull info like the status of the connection, arrival of messages, message "life cycle" within the tag, etc...

## How it works ##

This demo shows how to use a third party script to implement a javascript console. We will use the [Firebug](https://getfirebug.com/firebuglite) script.

As you can see in the example, we just need to import the **firebug** script before xRTML script.
