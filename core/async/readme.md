# xRTML Async Module
This module provides straight-forward, powerful functions for working with asynchronous JavaScript. This module is based on [Resistance](https://github.com/jgallen23/resistance "Resistance"). We could also have used the [Async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async) but all those extra functions would be a waste of bytes in the framework.

## How it works
This demo shows how to use the both functions provided by the module.
